**Version 1.0.1**
Code and samples of the html structure and a css stylesheet of the second "Probleamtica Semanal" from the Become a software developer course. 
In this code i took a newspapper web page, found a news and try myself to recreate the structure of that web page with the basics html and add format with the css styling lenguage.
The main concern was the accurate election of a news that contains diverse elements (paragraphs, images, links, tables, list etc), the proxility of the code and the correct use of semantics in html.
In the css code the focus is in the correct use of some basic css syntax in structures like selectors both using id, classes or html elements. 
The practice of positioning, colouring and styling some elements.
One of the determinate things i wich i focused was the internalization of the so called "Buenas Pr√°cticas" of the both css and html coding, these good practices suchs as proxily, coherence and adaptability are not strictly requiered to be a programer but neccesary to be a good programer and make individual and group work more efficient.
